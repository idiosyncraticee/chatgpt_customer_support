Please know the<br>full amount of the funds can be re-used toward the<br>purchase of another flight to any Southwest<br>destination. We hope you can find another city to<br>visit! ^JB USER--> @SouthwestAir I sent a dm with<br>my response to that answer. With 3 kids in school<br>and 2 full time jobs I can't just pick and go to<br>another SW city. That takes money, time and<br>planning. It's not like I wanted to cancel my trip<br>but I can't control nature and what it brings",
